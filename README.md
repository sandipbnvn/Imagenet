## Implementing a PySpark Pandas UDF to make predictions using a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model

Te code showcases the integration of Apache Spark and TensorFlow for deep learning tasks. The notebook covers the following key aspects:

- **Environment Setup:**
  - Configuring Spark with OpenJDK 8 and TensorFlow in a Colab environment.

- **Data Processing:**
  - Reading and processing a sample image dataset using PySpark.
  - Extracting labels and sizes from image file paths.

- **TensorFlow Integration:**
  - Utilizing TensorFlow to preprocess images for deep learning tasks.

- **Image Classification with MobileNet V2:**
  - Implementing a PySpark Pandas UDF to make predictions using a pre-trained MobileNet V2 model.
  - Displaying and analyzing prediction results on a subset of the dataset.
